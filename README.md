The assembler takes high-level assembly-like code and translates it into machine code, ensuring proper syntax, operand usage, and variable handling. It supports various operations like arithmetic, logic, branching, and memory operations, including handling IEEE floating-point numbers. The simulator, on the other hand, takes the machine code generated by the assembler and simulates the execution of the custom ISA instructions. It includes a memory model, register management, and flags handling to accurately simulate the behavior of the custom ISA.
